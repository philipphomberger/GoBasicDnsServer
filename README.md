In this Project, I build for learning purposes a DNS Server with GoLang.
Set up a Socket Server and convert binary data back to protocol. 
Search for the Host in the JSON Database and return the IP Address with the DNS Protocol as binary.

Using google/gopacket package to not reimplement the DNS Protocol from Scretsh.

Learning:
- How DNS Works under the Hood.
- How to read dns Protocol from binary.
- How ro write a dns Protocol answer to host.
- Deeper understanding How to Setup a UDP Server in GoLang and how send answers to the client.
